# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
npm install          # install deps
npm run dev          # run from source via ts-node (no build)
npm run typecheck    # tsc --noEmit — the only "test" gate; run after edits
npm run build        # compile src/ -> dist/
npm start            # run compiled dist/index.js (used in production)
```

There is **no test suite**. `npm run typecheck` is the correctness gate — `tsconfig.json` runs in `strict` mode with `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, so optional/undefined narrowing is enforced. Production runs the compiled output under pm2 (`ecosystem.config.js`).

## What this is

A Telegram **Secretary Mode** (Business Mode) bot: when someone messages the *owner's* Telegram account, Telegram forwards it to this bot, which replies using Google Gemini 2.5 Flash. The persona is **first-person impersonation** — it replies *as* the owner ("tomorrow's packed"), not as a third-party assistant ("Doston is busy"); the `SYSTEM_PROMPT` and voice examples must stay first-person or the model breaks character. Requires Telegram Premium on the owner's account to connect. Config is via `.env` (see `.env.example`); `OWNER_USER_ID` is the owner's numeric Telegram ID, `OWNER_TIMEZONE` (default `Asia/Tashkent`) grounds date/time answers.

## Architecture — the non-obvious parts

**Two separate update streams that must not be confused:**
- `business_message` → the auto-responder (`src/handlers/business.ts`). Messages *to the owner* in managed chats.
- normal `message` → a static canned reply (`src/handlers/direct.ts`). Messages sent *directly to the bot*.

Business messages arrive as `business_message` updates and **never** trigger the `message` handler, so the two handlers don't overlap.

**`allowed_updates` is load-bearing.** Telegram does *not* deliver `business_*` updates unless they're explicitly listed in `bot.start({ allowed_updates: [...] })` in `src/index.ts`. Dropping them there silently breaks the entire bot with no error.

**Reply flow** (`business_message` handler):
1. Skip if no text, no `business_connection_id`, or sender is the owner (`from.id === OWNER_USER_ID`) — prevents the bot replying to itself.
2. Skip if the connection's `can_reply` is false.
3. Call Gemini with per-chat history.
4. `ctx.api.sendMessage(chatId, reply, { business_connection_id })` — the `business_connection_id` option is what makes the reply go out *as the owner*. Omitting it sends as the bot.
5. **History is persisted only after a successful send**, so a failed send never poisons the conversation context.

**Voice profile** (`src/profile/voice.ts`): `buildSystemPrompt(base)` composes the final Gemini system instruction from `SYSTEM_PROMPT` + style hints + few-shot examples loaded from `voice.json` (gitignored real file) or `voice.example.json` (committed fallback). Composed **once** at startup in `business.ts` (`COMPOSED_SYSTEM_PROMPT`), so editing `voice.json` requires a restart. The examples are what make replies sound like the owner rather than a generic assistant — prefer adding real example pairs over lengthening the prompt.

**Contacts** (`src/profile/contacts.ts`): `getContactContext(chatId, username)` returns a per-message context line ("You are talking to X (client). Tone: … Notes: …") resolved by `chat_id` first, then `@username`, then a `default`. Loaded from `contacts.json` (gitignored) or `contacts.example.json` (fallback). This is where per-sender tone *and rules* live (e.g. "never quote a price").

**Facts / knowledge base** (`src/profile/facts.ts`): `buildFactsContext()` injects `facts` (statements the bot may rely on) + `faq` (question→answer guidance) from `facts.json` (gitignored) or `facts.example.json`. It **always** appends a hard guard against inventing personal/sensitive details (relationships, finances, address, plans) even when no facts file exists — without it the model confidently fabricates personal facts (e.g. stating a marital status). Composed once at startup as `FACTS_CONTEXT` in `business.ts`.

The full per-message system prompt order is: `COMPOSED_SYSTEM_PROMPT + FACTS_CONTEXT + ownerContext() + getContactContext(...)`. The first two are static (built once at startup); `ownerContext()` (fresh date/time) and the contact lookup are recomputed per message.

**Gemini wrapper** (`src/ai/gemini.ts`): `generateReply()` calls 2.5 Flash with **thinking disabled** (`thinkingConfig: { thinkingBudget: 0 }`) so its chain-of-thought can't leak into the sent message, plus `sanitizeReply()` strips any leftover `THOUGHT:`/`Answer:`-style preambles as a backstop. The voice prompt also carries a "message only" guardrail. All three exist because the model otherwise sometimes emits its reasoning as the reply text.

**Session store** (`src/store/sessions.ts`): in-memory `Map` keyed by `` `${business_connection_id}:${chat_id}` ``, capped at 40 entries (20 pairs). Roles use Gemini's convention — `"user"` (incoming) / `"model"` (our reply), *not* OpenAI's `assistant`. History must start with a `user` turn; the append order (user then model) guarantees this. **Memory is process-local and wiped on restart** — swap for Redis/SQLite if persistence is needed.

**Connection lifecycle** (`business_connection` handler): stores/clears `ConnectionInfo` in a module-level map and DMs the owner on connect/disconnect. `can_reply` is read defensively via `extractCanReply()` because Bot API 9.0 moved it from the connection root into `rights.can_reply` — read both to survive either grammY/types version.

**Error handling deliberately stays silent in two cases:** `BUSINESS_CHAT_INACTIVE` (the message is outside Telegram's 24h reply window) is skipped without notice; Gemini failures notify the owner but send *no* reply rather than a broken one. Never replace these with a fallback/placeholder message to the contact.

## Gotchas

- **`@google/generative-ai` is deprecated** in favor of `@google/genai`. It still works with `gemini-2.5-flash`; if you touch `src/ai/gemini.ts`, consider migrating. Note `thinkingConfig` isn't in this SDK's types — it's passed via an `as unknown as GenerationConfig` cast and only honored by the REST API. The newer SDK types it properly.
- Only **text** messages are handled — photos/voice/stickers are ignored in the `business_message` handler. Extend there to support them.
- Long polling means **one instance per token** — running two concurrently conflicts.
